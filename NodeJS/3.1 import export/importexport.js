//* What is the difference between import and require?
//import is used in ES6, require used in commonJS
// import performs better than require because it can be asynchronous, while require is loading synchronouse.
//require can be called from anywhere in the program and import only runs at the beginning of the file.

//* How can you enable using the import syntax using node js
// save the file with ".mjs" or
// add in the package.json - {"type": "module"}

//* Give 2 node.js environment variables that are not available when using the import syntax.

//* Create 3 functions using the export/import syntax.

//* Import the file system module using the import syntax.
